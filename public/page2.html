         <p>*  League of Legends is an insanely popular online competitive game that's been around for 7+ years. Fnatic as an organization had entered into the
        competitive scene in 2011 and during that year they would go on to win the very first championship, amassing $50,000 dollars as the world champions</p>
         <p>*  Fast forward to 2017 and the organization is still thriving within the game. Winning multiple titles in the european challenger series, they've not only grown 
        their organization to new heights, but also improved, made roster changes, switched around management, and gotten new direction.</p>
